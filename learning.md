Adaptive RAG techniques: New papers like Adaptive RAG and Corrective-RAG propose dynamically selecting RAG strategies based on query complexity. Implementations are available as LangChain and LlamaIndex cookbooks.

allows nested access to the event loop: enables the execution of multiple event loops within a single thread or process. An event loop is a programming construct that waits for and dispatches events or messages in a program. It is typically used in applications that need to handle multiple tasks concurrently, such as user interface (UI) applications or network servers.

In a nested event loop scenario, an outer event loop can spawn or create an inner event loop, which can then process its own events independently of the outer loop. This allows for more complex and flexible event handling, as it enables the creation of hierarchical or layered event processing structures.
