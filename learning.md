Adaptive RAG techniques: New papers like Adaptive RAG and Corrective-RAG propose dynamically selecting RAG strategies based on query complexity. Implementations are available as LangChain and LlamaIndex cookbooks.

allows nested access to the event loop: enables the execution of multiple event loops within a single thread or process. An event loop is a programming construct that waits for and dispatches events or messages in a program. It is typically used in applications that need to handle multiple tasks concurrently, such as user interface (UI) applications or network servers.

In a nested event loop scenario, an outer event loop can spawn or create an inner event loop, which can then process its own events independently of the outer loop. This allows for more complex and flexible event handling, as it enables the creation of hierarchical or layered event processing structures.

# Langchain - LLMs powered Apps

Initialize model via APIs to generate text based on Prompts

- prompt template: guide input & required parameters
- Chaining: template | model call
- output parser: StrOutput Parser | Chaining (human readable output)
- Streaming: LangChain Expression Language - returns a generator that will yield output as soon as itâ€™s available
- Guide Generation with Context - Provide Source information and try to fetch specific info for that.
- Debugging - LangSmith: DevOps platform for developing, collaborating, testing, deploying, and monitoring LLM applications, LangSmith allows users to trace and evaluate their language model applications and intelligent agents, providing tools for debugging, testing, and evaluating LLM applications to ensure high-quality outputs and performance monitoring. It supports all phases of the development lifecycle, addressing the challenges posed by the non-determinism and unpredictable nature of natural language inputs in LLMs
