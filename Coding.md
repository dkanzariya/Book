Elegent Code

In reality, a balanced combination of both—understanding the approach and then diving into the code—is ideal for holistic development.

DRY: Don't Repeat your self

KISS: keep it simple, stupid.

Premature Optimization is the Root of All Evil: Coined by Donald Knuth. It warns against optimizing before understanding what parts of the codebase are performance bottlenecks.

Separation of Concerns: Different concerns should be isolated from each other to achieve modularization.

Fail Fast: Systems should be designed to immediately report any failure or conditions likely to lead to failure.

Occam's Razor: Among competing hypotheses, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected.

Eat Your Own Dog Food: Use your products, it's the best way to find out how they work in real-world scenarios.

Law of Demeter (Principle of Least Knowledge): An object should only communicate to its immediate neighbors and know as little as possible beyond that.

Go with worst or at least average-case analysis, never best-case analysis

Focus on Self-Care: Take care of your physical and emotional well-being. Eat healthily, exercise regularly, get enough sleep, and engage in activities that make you happy.

Focused Deep Work: Many experts recommend aiming for 2-4 hours of focused deep work per day. This is based on the idea that maintaining a high level of concentration for an extended period can be mentally taxing. Four hours is often considered a practical upper limit for most people.
