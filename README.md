- ###### *Counting (permutation and combinations)*
Counting is a fundamental concept in mathematics and statistics, particularly in the fields of combinatorics and probability. It deals with determining the number of ways certain arrangements or selections can be made. The two primary methods of counting are permutations and combinations, both of which are used to count the number of different ways to arrange or select items from a set.

+ Permutations: A permutation is an arrangement of items in a specific order. When counting permutations, the order of the items matters.
  1. Permutations without Repetition: Used when we are selecting items from a set and the order matters, with no item being used more than once. The number of ways to arrange n distinct items is n! (n factorial)
  2. Permutations with Repetition: Used when items are allowed to be repeated. For example, the number of different possible passwords of a certain length using a given set of characters. If there are
 n items and we are choosing r of them, the number of permutations is  (nCr).
